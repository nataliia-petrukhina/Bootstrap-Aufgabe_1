[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Your task is to create a simple page using bootstrap. Work in the existing `index.html` file

## Requirements

- Use the mockup image below as a guide.
* Your page must include the following sections: a banner, a navigation bar, a simple flex layout, card placeholders and footer!
* You shouldn't have to use _any_ CSS to make this page!
* Refer to bootstrap documentation for more info, sometimes you might find ready made components, sometimes you might want to write the HTML yourself and use helper classes.
